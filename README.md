# Reinforcement Learning Project on OhHell

Run the testing.py file. I used Python 3.10. Install RLcard with pytorch.
# Credits
Throughout this project I used a lot of different resources and techniques to create the game environment and neural network

- The structure of the game environment - [RLCARD](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard)
- The idea to train the agent against itself (NFSP) - [NFSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01121) 
- A template project using PPO on the game Big2 - [Big2PPO](https://github.com/henrycharlesworth/big2_PPOalgorithm)
- For an implementation of the PPO algorithm in PyTorch - [SB3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
